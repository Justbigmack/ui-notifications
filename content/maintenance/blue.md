On Tuesday, October 27th we will roll out release 189. Rollout for EU customers is scheduled to start at 9am UTC.

During the rollout we will change the ingress IPs for ingress-blue-saas.instana.io / saas-eu-west-1.instana.io to 54.217.106.230 and 54.220.25.116. Please add these IPs ahead of time to your egress network config in case your are blocking egress traffic by IP.

This only impacts EU customers that are using ingress-blue-saas.instana.io or saas-eu-west-1.instana.io in their Instana agent backend configuration.
