Along with our Kubernetes monitoring, we also now support OpenShift. See our [Openshift docs](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/openshift/) for details.

**Please Note:** An update to your instana-agent OpenShift configuration is required. For more details see [Openshift setup](https://docs.instana.io/quick_start/agent_setup/container/openshift/)

### Ceph

We've also added monitoring of the Ceph distributed storage system. See our [Ceph docs](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/ceph/) for details.

### Node.js v10

Ahead of official LTS in October, we now support Node.js versions 10.0.0 and above. See our [Node.js docs](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/node-js/#supported-versions) for details.

### Python SUDS (SOAP) Visibility

The latest Python sensor now includes instrumentation for the [suds-jurko package](https://pypi.org/project/suds-jurko/).
