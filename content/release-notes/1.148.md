## Features

### Analytics Capabilities in Website Monitoring Dashboards

In release 146 we introduced advanced analytics capabilities on website monitoring data within the analyze product area.
This allowed advanced queries and through that unbounded analytics. This is great for very specific questions and
validation of hypothesis, but it is also non-trivial to do.

With this release we are introducing analytics capabilities to our website monitoring dashboards! This is done with
the help of the quick filter bar found in the analyze area of the product. This filter bar is now also available in
the dashboards! This super powerful feature can be used to easily slice and dice dashboards to support use cases
such asâ€¦

 - focusing on the performance of a single browser,
 - limiting all data to that of a specific geographic location,
 - looking into A/B test participants' experience via meta data.

### Configurable Metrics in Ungrouped Website Monitoring Analysis

Release 146 introduced configurable metrics for the grouped website monitoring analysis views. This release extends
the capabilities so that the selected metrics are shown in the ungrouped view as well. This enables closer
inspection once an interesting group of data points as been identified.

### Page View Visualization

Page views can be complicated to understand just from an activity list. This release adds a visualization to understand
when there was a lot of activity on the page.

### Configurable Metrics in Grouped Traces and Calls Analyze View
The Analyze grouped traces and calls views also support configurable metrics such as latency percentiles.

### PingIdentity Directory Server

Instana now supports PingDirectory server. Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/ping-directory)

### AWS Elasticsarch

Instana now supports AWS Elasticsearch service. Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/aws-es)

### Haskell Support

Instana now has support for Haskell. Take a look at the Instana Haskell Trace SDK on
[Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/instana-haskell-trace-sdk) and
[Github](https://github.com/instana/haskell-trace-sdk) to find out more.

### Automatically include Downstream Services in Applications

When creating an application, you can now automatically include services that are downstream from an entry point, and they will become part of the application. That way you do not have to manually update the definition of an application in case your infrastructure changes, instead it will maintain itself, based on the path that the calls take.

### Automatic End User Monitoring Correlation for Java

When End User Monitoring is active on Webpages that are generated by Java HTTP frameworks, as Servlet, Spring, Play, Jersey or any other supported library, we now automatically correlate that call with the browser activity via the `Server-Timing` header we set.

### More Container Support

The agent now supports containerD and LXC containers in addtion to the previously supported Docker, Garden runc and Mesosphere UCR containers.

### Azure SQL Server Support

Instana now supports monitoring of Azure SQL Logical Server. Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/azure-sqlserver).

### Azure SQL Elastic Pool Support

Instana now supports monitoring of Azure SQL Elastic Pool. Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/azure-sqlelasticpool).

### Other Features

* We have introduced notifications that will alert you when there are updates to the user interface. The notifications will prompt you to refresh your page to get the latest version of Instana loaded to your browser.
* Performance counters are now available on Windows hosts. Please find detailed information [here](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/dot-net/#custom-performance-counters).

## Improvements

* Sensitivity for deprecation markers in the website monitoring area was reduced. This is a response to deprecations still occurring in less than 0.01% of cases.
* JBoss 4: Thread pools & DB connection pools
* JBoss AS: Added flag to disable EJB deployments monitoring
* The settings pages got a major overhaul.
* Use "Inbound Calls" label on Application and Service dashboards to clarify that only calls coming from outside of the application or service are counted.
* Statsd Sensor: Allows to configure a bind-ip instead of listening on all interfaces.
* Java Tracing: Supports MongoDb 3.8+ drivers and Play Stream Handlers
* Etcd Sensor: Improved disk latency calculation and SSL certificate support
* Kubenetes Sensor: Less memory usage and no longer exclude the agent pod
* Cassandra Sensor: Support DataStax Enterprise 6.x
* HAProxy Sensor: Non-worker parent processes are no longer being shown
* Azure SQL Database: Databases are shown as hosts. vCore-based resource monitoring is supported.
* Prevent saving of custom issues and alerting configurations with invalid Dynamic Focus query

## Fixes

* AWS CloudWatch metric drops fixed.
* Fixed an issue which had caused event/issue/incident details to either take long to load or load not at all in some cases.
* Fixed an overlap in two identical events on the same entity when the events are triggered one after another
* Fixed false sudden increase/drop detections in certain edge cases of bimodal metric value distributions
