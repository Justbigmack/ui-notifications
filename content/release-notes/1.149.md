[![Detailed Release Notes](https://img.shields.io/badge/detailed%20release%20notes-149-brightgreen.svg)](https://docs.instana.io/releases/notes/build_149/)

## Features

### New Python Logging Instrumentation

With this release, log message of level WARN or higher are now reported to your Instana dashboard. You can even drill-down into the stack trace if one was reported with the log.

### Improved control of your AWS services

With recent changes to our monitoring of the AWS services you can now specify deeper which and how often you want to poll AWS's API for metrics. To further configure the Instana Agent, just jump to the [Agent configuration file](https://docs.instana.io/quick_start/agent_configuration/#configuration) and add the sections documented [here](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/aws/index.md).

### Amazon MQ

Instana now automatically discovers and monitors Amazon MQ instances. Read more about our [AWS support](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/aws)
