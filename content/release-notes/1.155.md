# Build 155

## Improvements

- Etcd Sensor: Improve metric negative values handling
- MySQL Sensor: MySQL 8 support
- RabbitMQ Sensor: RabbitMQ 3.7.14 support
- Application Perspective & Analyze Traces: when viewing data on the Application Perspective dashboards or on the Analyze View over a large time range, it could be slow to get all the results because Instana has stored a very large amount of traces and calls in that time range. Since large amounts of data contain a large amount of redundancy, approximate results will be displayed to ensure an optimal query response time. An indicator will be displayed in this case and the time range of the query can be reduced to access precise data.

## Fixes

- Dynamic Focus: The `entity.selfType:process` and `entity.selfType:host` queries match only the events corresponding to the particular entity type, excluding the events of Application, Service and Endpoint entities. 
- Kafka: Fix Partitions count in the `Topics/Partitions` for Kafka Cluster
- Updated Kubernetes supported versions
