# Build 157

2019-07-02

## Features

- GraphQL tracing (see [GraphQL](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/graphql) for details)

## Improvements

- Php Sensor: improved CPU usage
- Php Tracer: New and improved MongoDb instrumentation
- Php Tracer: capture errors on IBM DB2 queries
- Redis Sensor: Add memory fragmentation ratio
- Service Mapping: Improve service naming based on jdbc connection string by using the database schema name as service name. This improvement provides better support and more consistency across different database technologies.
- When Amazon EC2 `Name` tags are used to name a group of hosts, unique host naming will fallback to FQDN then hostname, as visible on the infrastructure map. See the [EC2 tags section](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/aws-ec2#tags) to learn more about how to collect EC2 tags.

### UI Improvement
- Improve Trace Detail to more clearly show difference in Erroreous Calls and Error Logs
- Display Error or Warning logs in the parent call
- Settings Area: By clicking the _Star_ button on the right hand side of the Dynamic-Focus-Query (DFQ) input field, a list with already stored filters pops up. By clicking on one of them it will be pasted into the input field.
- Icons in the dashboard breadcrumbs and the infrastructure map sidebar now reflect the health status of an entity.

## Fixes

- Php Tracer: show HTTP methods in `curl_multi` calls
- Php Tracer: fixes potential segfault in ElasticSearch instrumentation
- Php Tracer: INSTANA_SERVICE_NAME is now picked up on Apache
