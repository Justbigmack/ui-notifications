# Build 158

2019-07-16

## Features

### VictorOps integration

We have added an out-of-the-box alerting integration for [VictorOps](https://victorops.com).

### Redis cluster

Support for Redis running in cluster mode. [Read more](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/redis).

### Custom events

An additional system rule has been added in order to ensure the presence (and be notified in the absence) of entities on a host. This rule can be found under the name "Hosts that do not have matching entities running on them".

## Improvements

- Service mapping: improved the mapping between calls to Oracle and monitored Oracle instances, leading to better service names.
- Service mapping: use header `SOAPAction` as service name when present. Please note the ([required agent configuration to capture this header](https://docs.instana.io/quick_start/agent_configuration/#capturing-custom-http-headers))
- ContainerD and Garden containers are now supported in the application infrastructure tab.
- Trace Detail View: Display more specific names for Ruby render calls.
- Sybase SQL Anywhere health rules for server connection and database count. [Read more about our Sybase SQL Anywhere Health rules](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/sybase-sql-anywhere/)

## Deprecations

- Analyze: port tags (`mysql.port`, `redis.port`, etc.) will be removed with the next release (159)
