## Fixes

- PHP Trace Sensor: properly resolve `_default_` host names in Apache configs to the host IP address
- PHP Trace Sensor: performance improvements when parsing Sql queries
- Dynamic Focus: fixes a potential bug that a DFQ containing an application/service/endpoint term (e.g. `entity.service.name`) could contain results from other entities outside of the defined scope which are running on the same host.
