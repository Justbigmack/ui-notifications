# Build 160

2019-08-13

## Features

### Micrometer custom metrics health events
 - Instana now supports health events based on Micrometer custom metrics.
 - For existing Grafana dashboards using Micrometer builtin metrics - please switch to `Infrastructure custom metrics` in order to retain dashboard functionality.

### Solr cloud
 - Instana now supports discovery and monitoring of Solr cloud. [Read more](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/apache-solr).

## Improvements

 - Activity timelines within the website monitoring page load view will now adjust end-user timestamps when the end-user timestamp combinations are impossible, e.g. activity before the page is even loaded.
 - Sudden drop detection: improved the detector to not create false positives in case the Application, Service or Endpoint receives periodic infrequent calls.
 - It is now possible to link multiple Kubernetes services to multiple logical Instana services. See [Kubernetes](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/kubernetes) for more details.

## Fixes

- Alerting: alerts for an Incident don't create a redundant alert for the underlying Issue anymore that triggered this Incident.
- Kubernetes Cluster ComponentStatuses: Sometimes Kubernetes reports wrong health status for components. This results in
    incorrect issues + alerts. We are now trying to filter out these ComponentStatuses from creating incorrect alerts.
    For more information see [Kubernetes Health Rules](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/kubernetes/#built-in).
- Application Perspectives: Fix possible linking to infrastructure for SDK spans.
- Application Perspectives: unmonitored destinations (e.g. databases) that are called by their Kubernetes Pod IP are now linked to infrastructure.
