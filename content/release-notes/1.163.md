## Features

### Humio Logging Integration

Instana now supports viewing logs, reported to Humio, directly from Instana platform.

### Kubernetes CPU and Memory Usage

Instana now supports viewing CPU and memory usage for Kubernetes Namespaces, Deployments, Services, Nodes and Pods. The usage is calculated from the containers that are running as part of these resources. The usage is shown alongside the total resource requests and limits, and can be helpful in gaining insights into how well specified your limits and requests are.
