# Build 172

2020-03-03

## Features

### Cloud Foundry

- Support for Pivotal Isolation Segments.
- The instance identifier is now available for Cloud Foundry application instances. The instance identifier is displayed on the Cloud Foundry application dashboard, the Garden container dashboard sidebar, and the container infrastructure view.

### ELK Logging Integration

Configure your ELK Instance and see a direct link to your logs from views in Instana.

### Host

A list of Red Hat/CentOS packages installed on host can now be extracted once a day. 

### Custom Service Rule

A custom service rule could be used only to override the default service rules. Now with the introduction of the `service.default_name` tag, a custom service rule can also be used to extend service default rules with additional tags.  

For example, to separate your production and test services based on the host zone, create the custom service rule using the `service.default_name` and `host.zone` tags. 

## Fixes

* Fixed missing root call in traces started from XHR requests.
