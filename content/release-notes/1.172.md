# Build 172

2020-03-03

## Features

### Cloud Foundry

- Added support for Pivotal Isolation Segment
- Added the instance identifier for Cloud Foundry application instances. The instance identifier is visible within the Cloud Foundry application dashboard, Garden container dashboard sidebar and container infrastructure view.

### ELK Logging

Configure your ELK Instance and see a direct link to your logs from views in Instana.

### Host

Added support for listing of Red Hat/CentOS packages installed on host. 

### Custom Service Rule

Until now, a custom service rule could only be used to override the default service rules. 
With introduction of a special tag `service.default_name`, a custom service rule can also be 
used to extend service default rules with additional tags. E.g., if you want to separate 
your production and test services based on the host zone, you can create the custom service 
rule using the tags `service.default_name` and `host.zone`. 

## Fixes

* Fixed missing root call in traces started from XHR requests.
