# Build 174

2020-03-31

## Features

### Applications, services and endpoints dashboards

The "Infrastructure Issues & Changes" chart replaced the "Top Traces" widget on the dashboard "Summary" tab. The new chart can
help you find correlations between infrastructure issues or changes and application metric changes, e.g. increase of "Erroneous Call Rate"
or "Latency". For more information, see the [Infrastructure Issues & Changes docs](https://docs.instana.io/products/application_service_management/#infrastructure-issues--changes).

### New built-in metric for Kubernetes Deployment and OpenShift DeploymentConfig

We added a new built-in metric for Deployment and DeploymentConfig, `Available to Desired Percentage`, that allows you to create a custom event based on a percentage value of the ratio of available to desired replicas if the existing built-in event `Available replicas is less than desired replicas` for [Deployment](https://docs.instana.io/core_concepts/events_and_incidents/built_in_events/#kubernetes-deployment) or [DeploymentConfig](https://docs.instana.io/core_concepts/events_and_incidents/built_in_events/#openshift-deployment-config) does not meet your needs.

## Improvements

- The "Process Top List" on the host overview page shows the percentages aligned to the number of CPUs.
- The event detail page of CPU usage events shows the "Process Top List" if a host is involved.
- OpenShift 4.1 and 4.2 support.

## Fixes

- Website Smart Alerts: Fixed infinite loading indication of the chart in case there is no underlying data.
