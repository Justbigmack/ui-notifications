## Features

### Mobile App Monitoring: Open Beta

We're thrilled to open our Mobile EUM beta to all customers. To get started, head over to the [Mobile App Monitoring docs](https://docs.instana.io/mobile_app_monitoring/).

### Kubernetes Operator for the Instana Agent

Instana now provides a Kubernetes operator that installs the Instana Agent in addition to the Helm chart and YAML file options. For more information, please visit the [Kubernetes docs](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/#install-using-the-operator) or the [OpenShift docs](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/openshift/#install-using-the-operator)

### Custom Events for Dynamic Built-in Metrics

Custom Events on dynamic built-in metrics, such as Garbage Collection on JVM or available disk space on any host, can now be defined within Instana. Further information can be found in the [Define Custom Events docs](https://docs.instana.io/events_alerts/custom-events/#create-a-custom-event)).
