# Build 179

2020-06-09

## Features

- Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is now GA! Please consult the [documentation](https://www.instana.com/docs/admin/manage-users/) for full information.
- GraphQL operation names and types are now captured in our website monitoring when using [apollo-link-http](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-link-http).

## Improvements

- Improved contrast of dashboards and cards with new styling.
- Chart metric axis are now condensed so they only show the maximum value rounded up to the next good consumable value.
- Chart time axis are improved in a way the intervals are always readable.
- Improved long-term disk space detection: improved trend estimation and reduced chance that the issue is created after the metric actually stagnated already.
- The `event.severity` query keyword does now interpret the values "warning" and "critical" in DFQ for more convenience.

### Unbounded Analytics

- Added the following cloud providers in `cloud.povider` tag:
  - Azure
  - GCP
  - OPC
  - Nova (OpenStack)
  - Packet
- Grouping *Calls* in *Analytics* shows calls that do not match the given group by criteria. These calls are shown as *Calls without the 'xyz' tag* in the table, in which _xyz_ represents the chosen group by criteria. For API users this group is not shown as part of the result set. Further information can be found in the [Analyze Traces & Calls documentation](https://www.instana.com/docs/tracing/analytics/#filtering-and-grouping-traces-or-calls).

## Fixes

- Flow Map: traces starting with outgoing calls no longer cause missing services/endpoints or wrong KPIs.
- Agent List: give correct results based on the (DFQ) filters used.
- Trace Analytics: correctly transform Zipkin spans to HTTP type when `url` is present in span data.
- Custom Dashboards: The bar chart type now correctly renders multiple metrics for the same axis.
