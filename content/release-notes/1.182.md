# Build 182

2020-07-21

## Features

### Abnormal Process Termination sensor is now Generally Available

Never miss another process crash on Linux with the [Abnormal Process Termination](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/os-process#process-abnormal-termination) sensor on Linux/x64!
Beyond stabilization for GA, Abnormal Process Termination sensor gains support for:

- Container-optimized images on Google Cloud
- Ubuntu-based Cloud Foundry stemcells

### Custom Service Rule from JVM arguments

Custom Service Rules can be created using the tag `jvm.args`. The `jvm.args` tag can be used in any combination with other tags to form the service name according to your needs.

### New Python Celery Instrumentation

Starting with [version 1.23.0](https://github.com/instana/python-sensor/releases/tag/1.23.0) of the Instana Python package, automatic instrumentation for [Celery](https://pypi.org/project/celery/) is now included.

With this addition, you can now track, visualize and monitor the full request lifecycle of your Celery tasks from request, queue to completion.

If you are using the default [Python AutoTrace](https://www.instana.com/docs/tracing/instana-autotrace/), no steps are needed to update.  For [other install methods](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/python/#installing), the latest package is available [on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/instana/).

### Agent packages

* Use `apt_auth.conf` in the OneLiner and describe how to use it in the [Linux documentation](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/linux)
* Describe in the [Linux documentation](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/linux) the behavior of `tmpwatch` and its potential deletion of necessary files in `/tmp/.instana`, and describe a workaround to be deployed by customers discretionally.
* Describe in the [Linux documentation](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/linux) the behavior of `tmpfiles.d`, and add to the Linux agent packages (DEB and RPM) a `tmpfiles.d` policy to prevent the deletion of necessary files in `/tmp/.instana`. **Notice:** Due to poor default `tmpfiles.d` policies in Debian-derivates (including Ubuntu), we cannot disable the harmful behavior. Upon installing the agent package, you may see the following warning:

```log
WARNING: The tmpfiles.d policies of this system may cause the Instana agent to malfunction by deleting the /tmp/.instana directory; refer https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/linux#tmpfiles.d for more information.
```

### Google Cloud Storage

Instana now supports monitoring of Google Cloud Storage. This includes a built-in dashboard on Bucket level also with all the key metrics such as number of requests, number of objects and size of all objects.

## Improvements

* Added support for Redis 6 monitoring.
* Added support for the host agent for:
  * Debian 10 (Buster)
  * Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa)
  * CentOS 8
* Go sensor `v1.15.0` has added support for instrumenting database clients that use `database/sql` (see [documentation](https://github.com/instana/go-sensor#database-calls))
* AWS Sensor now can [run on ECS on Fargate](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/aws/#installation-on-fargate-on-ecs)
* Smart Alerts:
  * Improved algorithms for the computed baselines in daily or weekly seasonality.
  * Relaxed limitations regarding required historic metric data to enable the baselining functionality. Check out the [docs](https://www.instana.com/docs/website_monitoring/smart_alerts#prerequisites) for more details.
  * Keep Smart Alerts open up to 24 hours if no data is available for evaluation after triggering the alert
* Elasticsearch cluster name can now be used in Dynamic Focus Query (DFQ) to narrow the scope when creating custom events.
* Added support for .NET Core Aerospike Client (v3.8.0 and v3.9.4) tracing
* Python: Improved Span Tag Validation & Reporting [#247︎](https://github.com/instana/python-sensor/pull/247), [#245︎](https://github.com/instana/python-sensor/pull/245)
* Python Snapshot Collection: Protect against unknown exceptions [#246︎](https://github.com/instana/python-sensor/pull/246)

## Fixes

* Python AWS Lambda: Fix ARN Normalization which can affect service mapping in some cases [#242︎](https://github.com/instana/python-sensor/pull/242)

## Deprecations

* Debian 8 (Jessie) is no longer supported since it reached its end of life (EOL) end of June, 2020.
