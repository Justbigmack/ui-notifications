- Website custom events and page transitions analysis are now supported via the API.

### Unbounded Analytics: Latency Distribution

New latency distribution chart in Unbounded Analytics to quickly identify and filter outliers.

## Improvements

- Guided Application Perspective creation with preview of matched services preview
- The user interface's page load performance has been improved.
- Endpoint mapping is more resilient when path template is not captured due to missing entry span or client side error.

## Fixes

- NGINX tracing `v1.1.0`: Fixed the agent discovery for kernels without `/proc/$pid/sched` file.
- Boolean values are now correctly presented within the trace view.
- An uncaught error within the profiles user interface for profiled JVMs no longer occurs.
- Fixed metric formatting for several kinds of metrics, e.g. ping sensor's duration metric.
- Solr, Docker and RabbitMQ metrics are now available in Instana API.
- In the Agent Onboarding dialog, when copying `bash`, Dockerfiles and `cmd` scripts via the `COPY` button, the entire content is now copied in the clipboard.
- Custom Offline Events: Fixed a caching issue which caused that some events did not contain metadata such as entity label, FQDN or tags in case that entity just went offline.
