## Features

### IBM MQ

Instana now integrates with IBM MQ, so you can monitor the performance of your Queue Manager instances alongside related applications, and the infrastructure that runs it all. This includes a built-in dashboard that displays key metrics about your instancesâ€™ availability, number of messages, connections, queues, and more. For more information, see the [IBM MQ docs](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/ibmmq).

### SLO Widget

Instana now enables users to create widgets for your SLOs, in order to display and analyze the performance of your services over time. As part of the creation of SLO widgets, you can choose to create either _Time-based_ or _Event-based_ SLI configurations. For more information, see the [Service Level Objectives docs](https://www.instana.com/docs/service_level_objectives).
