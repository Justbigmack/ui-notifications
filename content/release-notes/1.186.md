## Features

### General Availability for Monitoring AWS Fargate

Instana's support for [AWS Fargate](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/aws-fargate/), so far available as a technical preview, becomes generally available with this release.

### IBM Db2 Remote Monitoring

Next to local Db2 instances, Instana is now capable of monitoring multiple remote instances.
They will be displayed as separate boxes in the specified `availabilityZone` on the Infra map.

### Elasticsearch Detailed Indices Metrics

Elasticsearch detailed monitoring for up to 200 indices now includes more than 20 metrics such as:
Queries, Get requests, Segment merges, Failed indexing operations, Evictions and Cache Memory.
Indices to be monitored in details need to be specified in the agent configuration with a regex.

### Weblogic SAF Agents monitoring

Extended Weblogic monitoring with collecting SAF Agent metrics. See the [Weblogic docs](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/weblogic) for more information.

### Google Cloud Storage .NET Core tracing

Instana now supports tracing of Google Cloud Storage for .NET Core applications.
