# Build 188

2020-10-13

## Features

### Google Cloud Pub/Sub Sensor

Instana now supports monitoring of Google Cloud Pub/Sub. This includes a built-in dashboard that displays key metrics about topics and subscriptions.

### Google Cloud Storage

* Python: as of [version 1.26.0](https://github.com/instana/python-sensor/releases/tag/1.26.0) the in-app sensor instruments Google Cloud Storage clients that use the [`google-cloud-storage`](https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-storage/) package v1.24.0 and above.
* .NET Core: as of [version 1.1.60](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Instana.Tracing.Core/1.1.60) of `Instana.Tracing.Core`, instrumentation for Google Cloud Storage is provided by instrumenting the [Google.Cloud.Storage.V1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Google.Cloud.Storage.V1/) package.

## Improvements

* Infrastructure & Agent view: Added DFQ fields making it possible to search for specific Agents / Hosts based on Agent details such as mode or bootstrap version
* Application dashboards: The Time Shift feature is made available for latency distribution.
* Smart Alerts: Added 15min and 20min evaluation granularity options to allow more tuning options when configuring an alert.
* CRI-O Sensor: The infra (or 'pause') container that runs in each k8s pod is now excluded from monitoring.

## Fixes

* Agent list: Fixed issue where 'offline' Agents were no longer correctly included in the list. Also, correctly show the timestamp when Agent started reporting.
* Elasticsearch: Fixed grouping nodes into a cluster using UUID when it's available.
* JBoss service naming: Fixed service mapping from JBoss deployment names containing special characters.

## Notes

Python 3.9 has been [recently released](https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html#:~:text=Python%203.9%20was%20released%20on%20October%205th%2C%202020.).
We are aware of regressions in a number of asynchronous instrumentations, like `aiohttp`, `tornado` and `asyncio`, and thus we do not currently support Python 3.9.
Please open a [support ticket](https://support.instana.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to inform us of your plans to move to Python 3.9 (and we also would love to hear why), so that we can prioritize support accordingly.
