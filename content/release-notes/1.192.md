## Features

### Agent: Process lookup and linking for externally ingested traces

Starting with `Agent 1.1.582`, the host agent can link on Linux systems the remotely-ingested traces to the process that generated them.
Remotely-ingested traces are those sent to the endpoints of the host agent that support [OpenTelemetry](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/opentelemetry), [Jaeger](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/jaeger/), [Zipkin](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/zipkin/) and [Trace Web SDK](https://www.instana.com/docs/api/agent#trace-sdk-web-service).
This capability works for process that:

1. are not ignored using the [Ignore Processes](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration#ignore-processes) capability;
2. run on the same host as the host agent, regardless whether these are running inside containers or not;
3. report traces directly to the host agent, rather than running over a proxy like the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector); if the tracing data go over a proxy, the proxy will be associated with the traces instead.

The Application Perspective Service dashboard will correctly reference any process from which related traces were ingested, including for example infra changes that took place for this service.

### Confluent Kafka

Instana now supports tracing of [Confluent Kafka](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Confluent.Kafka/1.5.0) client library for .Net Core. This includes instrumentation of producer and consumer calls with correlation between these two calls.

### Redesigned and Extended Custom Dashboarding

Custom dashboarding has seen excellent adoption across our customer base with a lot of feedback since its introduction. With this release, we introduce many changes/fixes to the widget configurator to make it easier to use, more flexible and prepare it for exciting future additions! Among others, the following is now supported within the widget editors:

 - All widget names are now optional
 - The chart widget editor now supports…
   - duplication and reordering of datasets
   - moving datasets to other axes
   - optional automatic duplication of datasets for timeshift comparisons
   - selection of colors for datasets
   - optional dataset labels
 - The time zone widget editor now has an improved time zone selector, making it easier to find the correct time zone.

As mentioned before, we also prepared custom dashboards for exciting new capabilities!


## Improvements

* Instana Agent Helm Chart:
  * Store the cluster name in a new `cluster-name` entry of the `instana-agent` ConfigMap rather than directly as the value of the `INSTANA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME`, so that you can edit the cluster name in the ConfigMap in deployments like VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid in which, when installing the Instana agent over the [Instana tile](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/vmware_tanzu), you do not have directly control to the configuration of the cluster name.
If you edit the ConfigMap, you will need to delete the `instana-agent` pods for its new value to take effect.
  * Support VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integration (TKGI) and older Pivotal Kubernetes Service (PKS) systems.
* Instana Agent YAML (a.k.a. Instana Agent Daemonset): Support VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integration (TKGI) and older Pivotal Kubernetes Service (PKS) systems.
* .NET Core and .NET Framework now support Agent configurable secrets. Please refer to [documentation](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration/#secrets).
* .NET Full Framework Tracing: Support configuration-base SDK
* .NET Core Tracing: Support configuration-based SDK
* Ruby Sensor: As of version `1.13.0` we generate [path templates](https://www.instana.com/docs/tracing/custom-best-practices/#path-templates-visual-grouping-of-http-endpoints) for the following frameworks:
  * Cuba
  * Roda
  * Ruby on Rails
  * Sinatra
* Ruby Sensor: As of version `1.13.0` we support redacting secrets from query paramaters based off of the agent's [secret configuration](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration/#secrets)
* Go: starting from [`v1.25.0`](https://github.com/instana/go-sensor/releases/tag/v1.25.0) the in-app sensor sends its version to Instana. You can find this value displayed in the left-hand side area of Go process dashboard or when selecting the Go process in the Infrastructure view.
* Go: as of [`v1.25.0`](https://github.com/instana/go-sensor/releases/tag/v1.25.0) AutoProfile™ for Go is Generally Availabile.
* We simplified creating a SmartAlert using a baseline via [API](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/createWebsiteAlertConfig) by making the `threshold.baseline` field optional. The baseline data will then be automatically computed based on the historic data.

## Deprecations

* For those using the Instana Agent Operator and [installing it manually](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/#install-operator-manually), please note that each new version of the `instana-agent-operator.yaml` in version `v1.x.x` and onwards will reference that same version of the `instana/instana-agent-operator` container image. We will no longer be updating the `latest` tag for the Instana Agent Operator image in DockerHub and the RedHat Registry. In order to get a new version of the Instana Agent Operator, you will need to update to the latest operator yaml from the [Operator's GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/instana/instana-agent-operator/releases) as mentioned in our [documentation](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes/#install-operator-manually).
