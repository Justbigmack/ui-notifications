## Features

### Custom Dashboard: Pie Chart Widget

With this release, we have added support for pie charts in custom dashboards. Users can add pie charts to their custom dashboards by clicking the `Add Widget` button in the top right corner.

### MongoDB Atlas

The Instana agent now supports remote monitoring of MongoDB Atlas clusters residing in different projects and organisations.
For more details, refer to the [MongoDB Atlas support](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/mongodb/#mongodb-atlas-support).

### Go AWS SDK support

The Instana Go sensor now offers [an instrumentation module](https://github.com/instana/go-sensor/releases/tag/instrumentation%2Finstaawssdk%2Fv1.0.0) for `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go`.
Currently supported services include DynamoDB, S3, SQS and SNS. To activate tracing, add `github.com/instana/go-sensor/instrumentation/instaawssdk` to your `go.mod` and follow the instructions
in the module [README](https://github.com/instana/go-sensor/tree/master/instrumentation/instaawssdk#usage).

### Node.js Tracing for AWS SQS

The Instana Node.js instrumentation now traces sending messages to and receiving messages from AWS SQS via the [AWS SDK 2.x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk). See the [Node.js docs](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/node-js/#supported-libraries) for all supported libraries.

### Agent Prometheus 'remote_write' endpoint

Next to 'scraping' metrics, Prometheus also allows for pushing metric updates via the `remote_write` endpoint and corresponding configuration.
Starting with Agent bundle 1.1.587, the Instana Agent includes support for the `remote_write` endpoint, meaning it is able to ingest metrics and these will be displayed as either a Prometheus Entity or part of the Process Custom Metrics.
Refer to the [Prometheus documentation](https://www.instana.com/docs//ecosystem/prometheus) for more information.

### Other Features

- Groups and API tokens can now be granted a new permission, allowing write access to all accessible custom dashboards. This comes in handy to remove unwanted custom dashboards, e.g., custom dashboards from former colleagues.
- Configuration-based SDK for .NET FF / .NET Core are now enabled by default

## Improvements

- Ruby Sensor: Replaced the usage of alias chaining with prepend.
- AWS Sensor: We now support the monitoring of multiple AWS accounts using the AWS STS Assume Role approach.
  For more details, please refer to [AWS documentation](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/aws#aws-sts-approach)
- Oracle Sensor: Since recently Oracle JDBC driver became part of Maven central repository, there is no need to manually set the JDBC jar file
- .NET Tracer: Support [process-ignore configuration](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration#ignore-processes)
- .NET Core Tracer: Support [process-ignore configuration](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration#ignore-processes)
- Node.js tracing: The instrumentation for the MongoDB native driver now also supports the "unified topology" connection mechanism.

## Fixes

- Ruby Sensor: GET requests via HTTP with no query parameters will no longer error.
- Agent: Small change to the startup scripts, to verify whether an Agent instances is already running and if so prevents starting a second instance.
