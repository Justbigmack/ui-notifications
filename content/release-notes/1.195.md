## Features

### Improved OpenTelemetry support (Technology Preview)

Calls happening in an OpenTelemetry-instrumented process and calls captured by Instana AutoTracing are now correctly correlated into the same trace for most runtimes. This feature requires up to date Instana tracers.

### Kubernetes: CronJob dashboard

Kubernetes CronJob Dashboard now displays the schedule and the list of Job executions on the Summary tab.
Active Jobs chart and Conditions were removed from the Summary tab.

### Other Features

- Ruby Sensor: We now support tracing ActionCable connections. All of the calls from a hijacked `/cable` connection will be shown under the trace of the initial web request.

## Fixes

- Agent list: When filtering the Agents list using Dynamic Focus Queries and no results were present, this sometimes led to the UI not rendering.
