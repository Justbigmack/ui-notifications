### Custom Dashboard: Ability to share max values between multiple Y axes

With this release, we have added a toggle in the axes configurator section of the custom dashboard. The toggle will be visible only when the user adds a secondary Y-axis.

With this toggle, you can set a common max value between both the Y axes. If the user hasn't manually set a max-value in the input field, the value will be calculated automatically using the data.

### Other Features

- Go: as of [v1.27.0](https://github.com/instana/go-sensor/releases/tag/1.27.0) Instana Go sensor correlates calls from OpenTelemetry-instrumented processes into the same trace.

## Fixes

* C++ Sensor 1.1.1: Fixed the NGINX secrets handling.
