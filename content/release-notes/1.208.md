### Sensor for Traefik reverse proxy and load balancer

Traefik app is now available on the dashboard together with its metrics.

## Go
Added instrumentation [instrumentation/instamux/v1.0.0](https://github.com/instana/go-sensor/releases/tag/instrumentation%2Finstamux%2Fv1.0.0) for [`github.com/gorilla/mux`](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) router.

## Improvements
