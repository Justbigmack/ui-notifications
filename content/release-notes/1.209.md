## Features

### Technology Preview:  IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6 Integration

This technology preview enables existing ITM V6 customers to integrate their existing monitoring with Instana.  Customers will be able to view their monitoring data in both the ITM V6 UI and the Instana UI simultaneously.
The Integration of IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6 with Instana is accomplished by updating the ITM V6 or ITCAM V7 agents to communicate with both the IBM TEMS server as well as the new IBM Monitoring Instana Integration Service.  The IBM Monitoring Instana Integration Service is the main portion of the technology preview.  It will transform the monitoring data from the V6 agents and provide them to the Instana server via the ibm-apmproxy sensor.
Please see https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/ibm-itmv6 for further details about this technology preview.

### Technology Preview: Apache HTTPd Tracing
Instana now supports tracing Apache HTTPd on xLinux 64.  For more information, refer to the [Apache HTTPd docs](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/apache-httpd#tracing).

## Improvements

* Go: a new instrumentation package [`github.com/instana/go-sensor/instrumentation/instahttprouter`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/instana/go-sensor/instrumentation/instahttprouter) has been released. This package provides instrumentation for HTTP servers that use `github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter` router.
* Application Monitoring: some kubernetes related infrastructure tags are now available when configuring Application Perspectives and Custom Dashboards. They can also be used in Unbounded Analytics for Calls and Traces. The new tags are
    - `kubernetes.cluster.version`
    - `kubernetes.namespace.labels`
    - `kubernetes.node.label`
* Unbounded Analytics: Charts are now toggleable. If you want to focus on your results an do not need a chart, you can remove it and add it back again later.

## Fixes

* Containerd: Missing Kubernetes search fields for pod uid, container name and pod name are added for the Containerd plugin
