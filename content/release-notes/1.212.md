2021-10-19

## Features

### Azure Queues

Azure Queues and Azure Queue Metrics are now visible on Instana Infrastructure as a part of Azure Storage component.

### Tracing MongoDB queries in Go services

An new instrumentation module [`github.com/instana/go-sensor/instrumentation/instamongo`](https://github.com/instana/go-sensor/tree/master/instrumentation/instamongo)
instruments MongoDB clients in Go applications to trace database requests. Further details as well as examples and usage
instructions can be found in the [module documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/instana/go-sensor/instrumentation/instamongo).

### Unbounded Analytics Chart Templates

We introduced preconfigured chart templates in Unbounded Analytics.
Chart templates show one or more charts to visualise key metrics of your data.

The new **Calls Overview** chart template, which replaces the latency distribution chart as the default chart for calls and traces, visualises

- Call Count
- Erroneous Calls Rate
- Latency

### Support Metrics from the Prometheus .Net Core Client Library

Metrics from the [Prometheus .Net Core client library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/prometheus-net/) are now available on the .Net Core process dashboard.
See [https://www.instana.com/docs//ecosystem/prometheus-netcore-client](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/prometheus-netcore-client) for documentation.

## Improvements

* CRI-O container labels are now available in the sidebar. 
* Containerd infra/sandbox containers are excluded from monitoring.
* Charts in Unbounded Analytics which display metrics related to errors (e.g. erroneous call rate) are now rendered red instead of blue to visually indicate this.

## Fixes

* IBM MQ: Fixed listener down event not triggered issue
* Fixed search by `entity.kubernetes.container.restartCount` issue for container runtime entities.
