# Build 221

2022-03-22

## Features

### Monitoring WebSphere Infrastructure

Instana now supports monitoring of IBM WebSphere infrastructure. This includes a built-in dashboard that displays WebSphere infrastructure information. For more information, see [WebSphere Infrastructure](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=technologies-monitoring-websphere-infrastructure).

### New web REST API endpoints for mobile app monitoring

More web REST API endpoints are available to query or analyze the collected mobile app beacons.

- [Mobile App Metrics](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#tag/Mobile-App-Metrics)
- [Mobile App Analyze](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#tag/Mobile-App-Analyze)

For usage examples, see [Web REST API examples](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=websites-web-rest-api-examples).

## Improvements

* Ceph Sensor: Now supports Ceph versions from 11 to 16.
* IBM Db2 LUW Sensor
  - Support for multi instance and multi db for local monitoring which now supports local monitoring for docker db2 container under separate configuration.
    **Note:**  
    - Local monitoring for docker db2 containers is not supported on Windows OS.
    - The local monitoring sensor has undergone a design change. If you are upgrading to latest Db4 sensor v6.0.23, you need to change your configuration file. The details can be found [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=technologies-monitoring-db2).  
* IBM ACE Sensor: Added support for custom Availability Zone for Integration Node.
* Integration with IBM APM V8: Added integration support for APM V8 MQ and ACE (IIB) agents.
* Integration with IBM Monitoring: Added integration support for ITCAM V7 MQ and IIB agents as well as APM V8 MQ and ACE (IIB) agents.
* IBM MQ Tracing:
  - Switched from Go Jaeger client to OpenTelemetry C++ client in the trace library.
  - Supported configurable tracing level for IBM MQ.
  - Translated IBM MQ completion code and reason code to meaningful messages in erroneous calls.
* IBM ACE Tracing:
  - Switched from Go Jaeger client to OpenTelemetry C++ client in the trace library.
  - Performance improvement to reduce CPU consumption.
  - Showed error messages in erroneous calls.
* Jenkins Sensor: Added API prefix auto-discovery from process arguments.
* MongoDB Sensor: Now supports MongoDB versions 4.4 and 5.0.
* Postgresql Sensor: The sensor is now able to process include directives in config files
* Statsd Sensor: Extended support for metrics formats to parse metrics with tags

## Fixes

* IBM Db2 LUW Sensor :
    - The old deprecated table `snap_get_dbm` is now replaced with `MON_GET_INSTANCE`. The columns `Remote Connections` and `Remote Connections Executing` from the old table are removed and the consolidated list of connections will be displayed as `Total connections` which is obtained from the new table.
* Redis Sensor: Removed locks to deactivate sensor without issues 
* IBM MQ Tracing: Removed unnecessary information to the standard output.
