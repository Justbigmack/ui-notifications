## Features

### Technology Preview - Synthetic Monitoring

- Providing APIs and UI to allow the technology preview customer to create synthetic tests to check their websites and applications.
- Support for Simple ping tests and API Script tests is being provided in this Technology Preview.
- Private, customer-deployed synthetic Points of Presence will be supported.

This feature is released as Technology Preview, which gives one partnering customer early views of the capabilities we intend to deliver in future releases.
In addition, we have published documentation of the Synthetic monitoring APIs in the OpenAPI specification and invite all customers interested in Synthetic monitoring
to review the APIs to make sure we are meeting your needs and addressing the challenges you need to tackle.  We invite you to provide feedback about the APIs
via our Ideas portal.  In future releases, we look forward to expanding the number of partnering customers to gain additional insights about how use of Synthetic
monitoring can meet your needs.
