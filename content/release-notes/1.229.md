2022-07-12

## Fixes

* [NGINX Tracer 1.7.1](https://github.com/instana/nginx-tracing#171-2022-06-29) and [Envoy Tracer 1.7.1](https://github.com/instana/envoy-tracing#171-2022-06-29):
  * Fixed the bug that the proxy sensor crashes when the tracing section of the instana configuration contains fields that are not used by the proxy sensor.
