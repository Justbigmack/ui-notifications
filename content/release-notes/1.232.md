# Build 232

2022-08-23

## Features

* New environment variable for logging in .NET and .NET Core

    * Instana now has a new environment variable **INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL_CAPTURE** for .Net and .Net Core to prevent creating spans for logs with lower level than the one set. For more information, see [Monitoring .NET Core](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=technologies-monitoring-net-core) and [Monitoring .NET](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=technologies-monitoring-net).

* Additional OpenTelemetry Components for Node.js

    * Instana now offers a number of additional OpenTelemetry components (propagator, sampler, and resource detector). See [OpenTelemetry Integration for Node.js Applications](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=net-opentelemetry-exporter) for more information.

* Technology Preview Synthetic Monitoring: updated landing page

    * The Technology Preview for Synthetic Monitoring is updated with additional information on the landing page.  The "List of Synthetic Tests" now includes Success rate, Latency and Locations.  A health indicator based on test success rate is also added.  If the test is associated with an application, the application label will appear and can be used as a link to the application page.  There are some known issues with behavior of this page including a created test will not be displayed until the first result is returned; and a paused test will not appear paused until the cache is refreshed. The test will appear paused on the Summary page, however.  We are working to resolve these issues as soon as possible.

## Improvements

* Improved-jboss-data-collection

    * Added regex configuration for more precise deployments monitoring. For more information,
    see [Monitoring JBoss AS](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=technologies-monitoring-jboss-as).

* Support for dynamic custom payload for Website Smart Alerts

    * Enabled support for configuring dynamic custom payloads in Website Smart Alerts. For more information, see [custom payload in Website Smart Alerts](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=applications-smart-alerts)

## Fixes

* Added a missing Approximate Data indicator when viewing a trace view. To see the Approximate Data Indicator, select a timeframe that is older than 1 month.
