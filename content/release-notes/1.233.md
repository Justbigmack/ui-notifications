## Features

* Technology Preview Synthetic Monitoring: applications filter

  * In the Technology Preview for Synthetic Monitoring, an additional tab has been added to the page for a selected application.  The new Synthetic Monitoring tab will display the list of synthetic tests associated with the application.  From here the user can navigate to the synthetic test summary and examine the results of any of the tests.

## Improvements

  * Kafka Header Migration

    * Starting from October 2022, Instana tracers will move to a new trace correlation header format for Kafka messages. No action on your part is needed. For more information, see [Kafka Header Migration](../../tracing/kafka-header-migration.md).

  * Technology Preview Synthetic Monitoring: Location selection for Network Timing

    * In the Technology Preview for Synthetic Monitoring, the "Network Timing" widget that is displayed for an HTTPAction test on the Summary page now has a dropdown to allow the user to select the location to view the timing information.  This allows the user to view the network timings for one specific location in the selected timeframe when the test has been assigned to run in multiple locations.

  * Azure Functions .NET support

    * The _Span preview_ page for Azure Functions in **Analytics** on Instana UI is updated by adding missing Endpoint information and expanding span data with Runtime and Method Name.
The metric list in the _Azure Functions Application_ page in **Infrastructure** is also updated. Metrics _FunctionExecutionUnits_ and _FunctionExecutionCount_ are deleted because they are not supported by the latest Azure Application Insights version.


  * Application Perspective Dashboard Performance Improvement

    * The performance of the Application Perspective dashboard over a larger timeframe is improved when the metric granularity is 4h, 6h or higher.
