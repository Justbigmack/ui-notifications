2022-11-01

## Features

### Technology Preview

#### Synthetic Monitoring: Enable migration

To support moving a customer's Synthetic Monitoring data to a different region, changes were made to the databases where the definitions of locations and tests are stored. These changes allow easier migration of the Synthetic Monitoring definitions if needed.

## Improvements

### Kafka sensor

- IBMÂ® Event Streams that is built on open-source Apache Kafka, is supported from IBM Event Streams v3.0.5 onwards.

### Log Analytics

- The display of long values in log tags is improved.
- Loading skeletons for logs are added.
- Logs can be expanded by clicking anywhere on the log line.

### Go Collector

- Starting with version 1.47.0, the Go Collector requires Go version 1.13 or later.

### Technology Preview

#### Synthetic Monitoring: Add sort capability to List of Tests

The _List of Tests_ page is updated to allow sorting by using any column except the **action** menu. The default sort order remains ascending on the test name.

#### Synthetic Monitoring: Response Status uses exact HTTP codes

The **Response Status** pie chart on the _Synthetic Test Summary_ page is updated to display the exact HTTP response codes that are returned for the simple ping test. Prior to this change, return codes are shown as a range, but now each specific HTTP response code that are returned in the test results in the selected timeframe is graphed.

#### Synthetic Monitoring: Update URLs

The URLs for the tabs on the Synthetic Monitoring landing page are modified to include the word _synthetic_ in the URL name. Prior to this change, the URL names are generic, and do not clearly refer to the Synthetic Monitoring portion of the Instana UI.

## Fixes

* IBM WebSphere Liberty Sensor: Fixed an issue that not all Servlets are listed on Instana UI.
