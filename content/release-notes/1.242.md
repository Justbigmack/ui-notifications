# Build 242

2023-02-07

## Features

### AWS API Gateway

Instana now automatically discovers and monitors AWS API Gateway. For more information, see [AWS support](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=agents-monitoring-amazon-web-services-aws).

### Open Beta

#### Analyze Infrastructure API

[Analyze Infrastructure](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=analytics-analyze-infrastructure-open-beta) is now supported on the API.
The API features an endpoint for [fetching entities along with metrics](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/getEntities) and [an endpoint for fetching entities grouped on a tag with aggregated metrics](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/getEntityGroups).
There are also endpoints to retrieve [entity types](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/getAvailablePlugins) and [metric names](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/getAvailableMetrics).

#### Synthetic Monitoring

**Synthetic Monitoring**, also known as proactive monitoring, is now available in Instana SaaS environments.
For more information see [Synthetic Monitoring Open Beta](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=instana-synthetic-monitoring-open-beta).

### Support for OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) version 0.19.0

Instana is now supporting OTLP version 0.19.0. Some fields have been added, changed, and removed from the protocol in this version. For the cases where fields were changed or removed, we've provided backwards compatibility despite breaking changes.

## Improvements

### Analyze Infrastructure group scope

A new [Permission Scope](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=instana-managing-user-access#permission-scope) for [Analyze Infrastructure](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=analytics-analyze-infrastructure-open-beta) is added, which allows using the functionality for groups with limited scope if granted. By default, permissions are not granted to groups with currently limited scope.

### Infrastructure Tag Catalog

The tag catalog used for filtering and grouping in the Analyze Infrastructure and Infrastructure Custom Dashboards is improved by removing irrelevant tags that won't return results. Only monitored tags in the environment are shown in the tag catalog. Furthermore, keys for key value type tags are promoted in the tag catalog, enabling easier search and discovery of user-provided tags.

### Open Beta 

#### Synthetic Monitoring: Associate synthetic test with an application

During creation of a synthetic test on Instana UI, you can assign the test to an application that is already monitored. An application selection list with filtering will appear in the final step of the **Create a test** wizard. You can also create a synthetic test that is not associated with any application.

#### Synthetic PoP: Helm charts are published

The PoP helm charts are published. You can specify `--repo https://syntheticpops.instana.io/helm` when you run the helm installation command. For more information, see [Synthetic PoP Deployment](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=beta-pop-deployment).

#### Synthetic PoP: Security enhancements

Some security enhancements are added in Synthetic PoP, such as removing unnecessary RBAC permissions in clusterorle, readonly filesystem in containers.

### Trace view

Trace latency KPI card was replaced by the trace duration KPI card. Trace duration is an interval between the start of the first and the end of the last call in a trace. Trace latency is the duration of the root call. If all calls within a trace are synchronous, these two metrics are equal. But if a trace contains some asynchronous calls, these two metrics can differ.

### Unbounded Analytics

An error message will be shown, if an invalid trace ID is used in a tag filter expression. Valid trace IDs are either 16 characters or 32 characters long.

The query builder will show only supported operators for ID tags. Previously, both supported and unsupported operators were shown.

## Fixes

### Custom dashboards: Fix permissions for personal API tokens

Previously, when a user access is granted to a custom dashboard, the personal API tokens don't have implicit access.
The users' access is only usable on Instana UI, instead of the API.
If the custom dashboard contains an invalid definition, the user is unable to view, edit or delete this custom dashboard.

Now the personal API tokens are implicitly granted the same permission as the user that it relates to.  
When you create or edit a custom dashboard, explicit access can be granted to adjust a personal API tokens access so that the personal API tokens have different permissions as the user that they relate to.

###  DB2: Days since last full database backup

Previously, even when an incremental backup was taken, it was interpreted as a full database backup.
This lead to alerts not being displayed or false alerts being displayed, and users raise issues for these wrong behaviours.

Now the problem is solved by picking the differences in days since the last full backup was completed.

### Open Beta 

#### The Export to CSV function in Analyze Infrastructure

The **Export to CSV** function in the _Analyze Infrastructure_ dashboard is updated to correct the export of percentage metric values. The exported metric values in percentage respect the same rounding (rounded to the nearest integer or to two decimal places) as on Instana UI.

### Unbounded Analytics

An issue that removing a chart metric causes a crash in the logging area is fixed.
