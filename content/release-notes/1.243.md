## Features

### IBM MQ Managed File Transfer monitoring

Instana now monitors current file transfers, and IBM MQ Managed File Transfer (MFT) resource monitors. For more information, see [IBM MQ Managed File Transfer monitoring](https://github.ibm.com/instana/docs/blob/467885853f77e32a7d0e3ffef6eb27c9390abd0e/src/pages/ecosystem/ibmmqmft/index.md).

## Fixes

### IBM MQ Sensor

Previously if the local queue manager was stopped when the host agent was started, the queue manager was shown in a separate box instead of as a layer of the host box. This issue is fixed.
Now if the local queue manager is stopped when the agent is started, the queue manager is not shown on Instana UI. Only after the local queue manager is started, the queue manager can be shown as a layer of the host box on Instana UI.
