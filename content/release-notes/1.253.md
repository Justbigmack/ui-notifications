# Build 253

2023-07-11


## Features

### Application API changes

The application trace API is changed. The endpoint `GET /api/application-monitoring/analyze/traces/{id}` (see [OpenAPI](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/getTrace)) is marked as deprecated and might be removed in the future.
The replacement for this API is `GET /api/application-monitoring/v2/analyze/traces/{id}` (see [OpenAPI](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/getTraceDownload)). The new API supports pagination and does not provide call data and stacktrace information.

### Node v20 support for Node.js tracer

Instana now supports Node.js v20.

### Open Beta

#### Action Framework

Action Framework is now available as Open Beta in Instana SaaS environments. By using this feature, you can add automation directly into Instana to diagnose and remediate events.

## Improvements

### Trace detail view

Added an orphan call indicator in the call tree.
