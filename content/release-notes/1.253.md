# Build 253

2023-07-11

## Features

### Application API changes

The application trace API is changed. The endpoint `GET /api/application-monitoring/analyze/traces/{id}` (see [OpenAPI](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/getTrace)) is marked as deprecated and might be removed in the future.
The replacement for this API is `GET /api/application-monitoring/v2/analyze/traces/{id}` (see [OpenAPI](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/getTraceDownload)). The new API supports pagination and does not provide call data and stacktrace information.

### Instana logs

Instana logs are now generally available. You can perform the following functions with the logs:

* Break down the logs and analyze them through Unbound Analytics by using its application and infrastructure context. For more information, see [Logging](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/logging/index.html).
* Correlate logs with metrics and traces by using the logs in the context of Kubernetes and containers. For more information, see [Analyze Kubernetes logs](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/ecosystem/kubernetes/index.html#analyze-kubernetes-logs).
* Enable launch-in-context integrations with third-party log aggregators. For more information, see [Logging integrations](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/logging/index.html#logging-integrations).

### Native histogram metric support

Native histogram metric support is a technology preview feature that enables the storage and visualization of Prometheus histogram metrics as a native metric type. For more information, see [Native histogram metric support (technology preview)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/custom_dashboards/histograms.html).

### Node v20 support for Node.js tracer

Instana now supports Node.js v20.

### PHP 8.2 support for PHP tracer

Instana now supports PHP 8.2.

### Open Beta

#### Action Framework

Action Framework is now available as Open Beta in Instana SaaS environments. By using this feature, you can add automation directly into Instana to diagnose and remediate events. For more information, see [Action Framework (Open Beta)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/automation/index.html).

### Synthetic monitoring feature is generally available

The Synthetic monitoring feature is generally available with Instana 253!
The supported features include:

* Create synthetic tests through the Instana UI or API for web applications and websites
* Use credentials in your synthetic tests; credentials are stored securely in Instana
* Deploy Points of Presence (PoP)
* Monitor PoP health by using the PoP sensor

**Note:** Points of Presence (PoP) must be deployed in the customer environment.

For more information on deploying PoP, see [Synthetic Monitoring documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/synthetic_monitoring/index.html).

## Improvements

### Synthetic Monitoring: Permissions for UI actions

Buttons and icons related to Synthetic Monitoring in Instana UI, which invoke actions such as creating a synthetic test, updating a synthetic test, or deleting a location, are visible only if the user has the appropriate permissions.
For example, if the user does not have the permission **Configure Synthetic tests**, then the **Add a synthetic test** button, the "Edit" action (**pencil icon** on the **Configuration** tab), and the "Delete" action (**trash can icon** on the **Configuration** tab) are hidden.
Similarly, if the user does not have the permission **Configure Synthetic Locations**, the **Action Menu** column on the **Locations** tab is hidden.

### Synthetic Monitoring: Support for additional zip formats

Additional file formats for `.zip` files are supported for creating API scripts for Synthetic monitoring tests through the Instana UI. Zip files with or without subdirectories are supported, including support of "." for the current directory and a single file in a `zip' directory.

### ContainerD entity label

ContainerD labels now display namespace and pod name when these are available.

### Trace detail view

An [orphan call](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/tracing/analytics.html#orphan-calls) indicator is added to the call tree.

## Fixes

### IBM i sensor

* Fixed the storage usage calculation of Auxiliary Storage Pool (ASP).
* Fixed the issue that all the services of AS400 were not being properly closed when the connection was closing.
* Fixed a issue that retrieval of Solid State Disk (SSD) information based on OS version and Level failed because the `UNIT_NVME` condition was not available.

### Synthetic Monitoring: Scroll through locations in the Create Synthetic Test wizard

Using the Create Synthetic Test wizard in the Instana UI, you can scroll through the complete list of locations.

### Synthetic Monitoring: Shared links include filters

Shared links from the Synthetic Monitoring UI pages include previously set filters, even for Smart Alerts.
