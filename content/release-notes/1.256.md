## Features

### AWS SDK v3 Kinesis instrumentation for Node.js tracer

Node.js tracer now supports instrumentation for Kinesis in AWS SDK v3.

### Recommended actions for associations

Go to the Associated Actions section of the [Issue](https://github.ibm.com/instana/docs/blob/main/src/pages/root_cause_analysis/index.md#issues) or [Incident](https://github.ibm.com/instana/docs/blob/main/src/pages/root_cause_analysis/index.md#incidents) page. In the Recommended actions section, you can see the top five AI-recommended actions, which are sorted by the confidence score. You can associate actions by clicking Associate Action in each recommended action row.

For more information, see [Recommended actions](https://github.ibm.com/instana/docs/blob/main/src/pages/automation/action-associations.md#recommended_actions_for_associations).

### Smart Alerts for Mobile App

For Mobile App monitoring, you can now get alerted on use cases such as throughput based on sessions and views, HTTP status codes, and custom events. For more information, see [Smart Alerts for Mobile App monitoring](https://github.ibm.com/instana/docs/blob/main/src/pages/mobile_app_monitoring/smart_alerts.md).

### Synthetic Monitoring: Browser test (Beta)

Synthetic monitoring supports Browser tests in a Beta test. Browser tests are available in Instana SaaS and available to all SaaS customers. By using Browser tests, you can create Synthetic tests that mimic the actions that users take when they use your web applications. You can create, modify, view, and delete Browser tests by using the Open APIs or the Instana UI.

A new playback engine is used to run these tests. You must upgrade your existing self-hosted Synthetic PoP to add the new playback engine to your PoP deployment. For more information, see [Using Synthetics to monitor endpoints](https://github.ibm.com/instana/docs/blob/main/src/pages/synthetic_monitoring/mon_endpoints.md) and [Browser test overview](https://github.ibm.com/instana/docs/blob/main/src/pages/synthetic_monitoring/browser_script/overview.md).

### Table widget for events

The table widget in your custom dashboards now allows you to see a list of events that have been triggered either live or within a specified time period. For more information, see [Table widget](https://github.ibm.com/instana/docs/blob/main/src/pages/custom_dashboards/table.md#example-table).


## Improvements

### Placeholder support in Synthetics Smart Alert title

You can now use dynamic placeholders as part of your Synthetics Smart Alert title. For more information, see [Smart Alerts for Synthetic Monitoring](https://github.ibm.com/instana/docs/blob/main/src/pages/synthetic_monitoring/smart_alerts.md)


## Fixes

### Synthetic Monitoring


- If an Instana application was deleted, the links to that application from Synthetic tests were retained, and the Synthetic tests with such links could not be updated. Now if an Instana application is deleted, the links in the Synthetic tests that are associated with that application are automatically removed.
- The `An unexpected error occurred` error message was displayed in the **Locations** tab if no Synthetic PoPs were deployed. Now the `No data available` message is displayed in the **Locations** tab if no Synthetic PoPs are deployed.
- In the **Results** tab for a Synthetic test, you were not able to filter Synthetic results from the deleted locations. Now you can filter Synthetic test results from the deleted locations. In the **Results** tab for a Synthetic test, you can select the name of the deleted location by using the Location filter to see the results from the deleted location within the selected time range.
