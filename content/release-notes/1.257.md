## Features
{: #features}

###  Nginx sensor
{: #nginx-sensor}
Nginx sensor now supports Windows operating systems. 


##  Improvements
{: #improvements}

###  Synthetic monitoring
{: #synthetic-monitoring}

- The title of the "Details" page for Synthetic test results is displayed in the breadcrumb style. You can use the elements of the breadcrumb to jump to the **Summary** tab of the Synthetic test.
- For a Synthetic browser test (Beta), if no browser logs are available for a specific test result, the **Browser** section of the **Logs** widget on the "Details" page is hidden.


##  Fixes
{: #fixes}

###  Synthetic monitoring
{: #synthetic-monitoring-1}

- Previously, if the time frame was set to **Live**, the **Locations** tab showed an error message. Now, because the **Live** time frame is not applicable for the **Locations** tab and the "Details" page of Synthetic test results, the **Live** time frame is disabled in these spots. If you attempt to select **Live** on the **Locations** tab or the "Details" page, the **Live** button is disabled, and a hover message informs you that the **Live** mode is not applicable on that page.  
- Previously, if a Synthetic location was deleted but the Synthetic PoP uninstallation was not successful, Synthetic test results were still accepted from the location, but they were displayed without a location name. This issue is fixed now. When a location is deleted, Synthetic test results from the deleted location is not accepted by the server.
- Previously, if all locations that were assigned for a Synthetic test were deleted when you edited the test, the Synthetic test could not be saved. This issue is fixed now. Synthetic tests that have no locations assigned can be saved when you edit the test.
