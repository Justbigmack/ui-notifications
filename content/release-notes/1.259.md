# Build 259

2023-09-27

##  Features

### Azure MySQL Database

Instana now automatically discovers and monitors Azure MySQL Database.


### IBM MQ Tracing

You can now specify a local source address for outgoing traffic from the IBM MQ Tracing user exit.


### Infrastructure payload APIs

New infrastructure endpoints are available that enable the retrieval of resource payloads:

- `GET /api/infrastructure-monitoring/catalog/payloads/{pluginId}` retrieves payload keys for a specific plug-in. Currently, this API retrieves only keys for the IBM Db2 Database plug-in (`db2Database`). For more information, see the infrastructure catalog APIs in the [OpenAPI documentation](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/getAvailablePayloadKeysByPluginId).
- `GET /api/infrastructure-monitoring/payloads/{snapshotId}/{payloadKey}` retrieves the payload for a specific snapshot and payload key. For more information, see the infrastructure resources APIs in the [OpenAPI documentation](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/getPluginPayload).

### Support for Workers metrics in JBoss sensor

JBoss sensor now retrieves `Workers` metrics, such as `BusyWorkerThreadCount`, `WorkerQueueSize`, and `ConnectionCounts` for JBoss EAP 7.0.9 or later.

## Improvements

### Allow users to unmask the Change Password input field

A new feature is added to unmask the **Change Password** input field to make sure that the password is entered correctly.

### IBM i sensor


Some metrics from Hardware Disk Drives (HDD), history logs, and overall disk status are updated so that users can view all the metrics in the Instana UI. Previously, users couldn't view all the metrics in the UI for the 3,000 metrics count limit.
The default poll rates for the following tables are updated:

  - Total Spool Space
  - Solid State Disk (SSD) Info
  - Network connections (Top Receivers)
  - Network connections (Top Sender)
  - Netstat Interfaces
  - Non Volatile Memory Express(NVMe) Information
  - Hardware Disk Drives (HDD) Info

### Logs with large messages

On the Logs page, improvements are implemented for the interface and behavior of log items with large messages:
- You can now expand and collapse the log message text with the log item.
- The action buttons on log items are aligned to the upper right for more convenience.

###  Unbounded Analytics

OpenTelemetry static tags, **OpenTelemetry Tag** and **OpenTelemetry Resource Tag**, are added as an alternative to the existing OpenTelemetry dynamic tags. While the existing dynamic tags are limited to 500 attributes, the static tags do not have this limit.

## Fixes

### IBM MQ sensor

Previously, the `agent.log` file contained a warning message, such as "Sensor com.instana.plugin.ibmmq:QmgrName-IP took 4450 ms". Now, the message is not included in the `agent.log` file.

### Two-factor authentication tokens

Two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens with a leading zero could not be entered in the Instana UI. This issue is now fixed.
