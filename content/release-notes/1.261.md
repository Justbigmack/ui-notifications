## Improvements

### Synthetic monitoring: UI enhancements for browser test (Beta)

In the Instana UI, the details page for a Synthetic browser test has the following enhancements:
- On the **Results** tab of the browser test details page, a **View Screenshot(s)** button is added. After you click this button, you can directly view the screenshots that are captured during the test run. Previously, you needed to download a `.zip` file to view the screenshots.
- The usability of the breakdown is improved. The breakdown of the calls in the **Timeline** section is incorporated into each entry.


## Fixes

### Synthetic monitoring

- Updating a Synthetic test in the UI maintains the values of properties that are set through the API or the synctl tool and are not displayed in the UI. Previously, the properties that were not displayed in the UI were reset to the default value during the update of a Synthetic test.
- You can correctly retrieve Synthetic test results by using the API and filter results by using `synthetic.errors`. Previously, an internal error message was returned.
- When you click the **Configuration** tab for a Synthetic test that was deleted, the message "Configuration details are not available for this test" is shown. Previously, an error message was shown.
